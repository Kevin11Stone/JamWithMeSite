# JamWithMe

This is merely a demo website for CPW 215: Advanced .NET Web Programming. This website is a demonstration
of what we've learned throughout our program at Clover Park Technical College (Computer Programming). 
This website also serves as our quarter project for the previously mentioned course.

### Website Premise 
This basic idea of the website is that once a user logs in, they're able to see fellow users' posts. These posts are
meant to display information regarding needs (musicians, equipment, places to practice, gigs etc.) and information the user wants
to show to local musicians (events, social gatherings etc.). This site also serves as a forum in which one is able to promote their 
endeavors and groups.

### Prerequisites

You'll need to have [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) installed. 
The appropriate [SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/visual-studio-sdks)
will also need to be downloaded (.NET Core 2.0 or higher).
